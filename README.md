Hi DevOps,

This is a Weight Management Meal Planning Web Application I built while working with a Nutrition Firm as a newbie.

INTERESTING FACT : It utilises Localised Meals and portioning items making it more reasonable to use.

TECHNOLOGIES USED :

    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3. JavaScript
    4. PHP
    5. MySQL(Database)
    6. TCPDF (For printing Reports)

HOW IT WORKS;

    1. Register a Client as the Nutritionist/Dietician.
    2. Login to the Web Application (as the Client).
    3. Capture the Client's Bio Data (Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Physical Activity Level)
    4. Select the Client's desired goal (Weight Management / Body Building).
    5. Proceed to Calculate the Client's EER(Estimated Energy Requirement) which simply is a value that shows how much energy the client's body needs to sustain itself under the current metabolism.
    6. Proceed to create a seven (7) days meal plan for each of the following meals; Breakfast, Midmorning Snack, Lunch, Mid Afternoon Snack, Supper and Late Supper Snack.
    
    The web apllication then calculates the Client's meal plan average intake for the week and prepares a well detailed report comparing the Reference Intakes and the meal plan.
    The Meal Plan can be saved as pdf or printed as an appropriate intervention for the Client's Goal to be achieved.

I built this Web application with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.

I know its just a prototype, and I'm seeking for collaboration to buid it on modern technologies and as a part of a greater project.
